## Python
Python is an object-oriented language

## Output
Output is the way the computer prints information to the user in the "console"

To output we use `print ()`

## Comments
Comments are notes that the compiler skips over

To use comments, we use `#COMMENT` for single-line
We use ```COMMENT``` for block comments

## Data Types

We Will be Working With 5 main data types

1. Integer (int)- whole numbers
2. Character (char)- single letter, symbol, or number
3. String(str)-collection of characters
4. Floating point(float)-decimal numbers
5. Boolean(bool)-True(1)/False(0)

## Variables
Variables are contianers that hold a value

### Rules for Variable names

Always start with a letter
1.   `1name ="Celine"`___>NOT ALLOWED
2. Can only contain numbers letters and underscores(_) `my name = "Celine"` NOT ALLOWED
3. If more than one word use camelcase or underscores to separate words.
4. 'myFirstName' or my_first_name

## Concatenation
`+` adding strings together, appending (end to end)
"Hello"+"World" =Hello World
## Type Case
Forcing a data type on a value

### To force a string into an integer
`int(variableName)`
